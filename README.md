This is a Monte Carlo Simulation on Markowitz's Essential Frontier theory. The assets of the portfolio were Nvidia, Gold and the S&P500, using weekly data for 8 years. 
The optimization was applied on two different occassions: a) allowing weights of w=[0.2,1] and b) allowing weights of w=[-1,2] so that's why there is a difference on the plots.
The main portfolios calculated were the one with the lowest volatility, the Safest one, and the one with the highest Sharpe Ratio, the Top performance one.
